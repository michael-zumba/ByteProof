# Live Proofread Preview — Checkpoint 1

## Current todo

- [x] Spec, plan, long-task records
- [x] Task 1: pure core (parse, map, trigger, cache)
- [x] Task 2: preview prompt + provider call + request refactor
- [x] Task 3: AX selection details, bounds, range replacement
- [x] Task 4: overlay underlines + hover popup
- [x] Task 5: live service orchestrator
- [x] Task 6: Word native underlines, sub-range apply, suggestion card
- [x] Task 7: settings schema + General-page controls
- [x] Task 8: end-to-end + cache-efficiency tests
- [x] Task 9: Word/TextEdit visual runs + accuracy corpus + packaged build
      (Mail compose and Pages partially environment-blocked; see evidence)
- [x] Task 10: full verification (suite green, installer notarized)
- [x] Polish round from Word testing: "Suggested changes" title, premium
      popup/card redesign with auto-sizing, direct background apply/apply-all,
      persistent marks + hover-after-deselect, reselect fix, permissive
      app/browser compatibility, AX descendant text search
- [x] Second polish round: Google-styled popup, single-control rebuild fix,
      working single Apply, accumulating marks across selections, hover
      survival across rect refreshes, wider AX search for Pages
- [ ] Integrate branch (user decision: merge / PR / keep)

## Completed evidence

- 37/37 `tests/test_live_preview.py` pass (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen ./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_live_preview.py -q`).
- Full smoke suite passes: `ALL_SMOKE_TESTS_PASSED`.
- Real DeepSeek accuracy corpus (`tests/corpus_live.py`) run twice: `CORPUS_RESULT failures=0` both times.
- Real TextEdit live run: trigger, DeepSeek preview (3 edits), dashed pink-red underlines
  pixel-verified on screen, hover popup window + red/green track-changes text
  pixel-verified, click-on-underline replaced "teh" with "the" in the document
  (verified via AXValue).
- Word AppleScript surface live-verified: selection positions, `create range`,
  `underline dot dot dash`, RGB color, `track revisions`, position/zoom info.

## Fixes found by the live campaign

- Repeated identical edits now map to distinct occurrences (removed pair dedupe).
- Overlay `setMask` now uses window-local coordinates.
- Removed the `Qt.WindowType.Tool` flag: it broke translucent-window compositing
  when the app also has a normal window.
- Hover/click input moved from the overlay window to a listen-only Quartz
  event tap (global mouse events do not reach masked non-key windows).
- `ax_replace_range` probes `AXUIElementSetParameterizedAttributeValue` before
  calling it; TextEdit uses the selected-text fallback successfully.

## Next

1. Word visual run (native underline + card + click apply).
2. Mail compose and Pages runs.
3. Packaged build via `./build_macos.sh` and packaged verification.
4. Final suite + evidence bundle + finishing-a-development-branch menu.

## Drift check

Scope unchanged (macOS beta, same four defaults). No new owners or schema
changes beyond the planned `settings["live_preview"]`. Decision: `continue`.
