# Live Proofread Preview — Evidence

## Automated tests

- `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen ./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_live_preview.py -q`
  → `37 passed` (parse, mapping incl. repeated occurrences, trigger decisions,
  cache/LRU, settings schema, Word AppleScript scripts, overlay render, service
  cycle, cache efficiency).
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen ./venv/bin/python tests/test_smoke.py`
  → `ALL_SMOKE_TESTS_PASSED` (existing behavior unchanged after the
  `_request_completion` refactor).

## Accuracy (real DeepSeek)

- `./venv/bin/python tests/corpus_live.py` run twice → `CORPUS_RESULT failures=0`
  both runs. Corpus: 5 defective sentences covering spelling, agreement,
  word choice, and repeated errors.

## Function (real apps, live)

- TextEdit: selection triggered one preview call (3 edits), overlay window
  positioned over the selection, dashed `#E23A5B` underlines pixel-verified on
  screen, hover popup verified (window + red strikethrough + green replacement
  pixels), clicking the underline replaced `teh` with `the` in the document
  (verified by reading the AX value).
- Word: selection triggered a preview (3 edits), native
  `underline dot dot dash` formatting applied to the exact ranges (verified via
  AppleScript), the suggestion card rendered (verified by window capture:
  202,076 opaque pixels, 746 green suggestion pixels), clicking a card Apply
  button changed the document from `teh cat...` to `the cat...`.
- Packaged `dist/ByteProof.app`: launches; Settings contains
  "Live Suggestions (Beta)", the enable checkbox, the delay slider, and the
  local-model checkbox (verified through the accessibility tree).
- Mail: shared AX capture path verified via TextEdit; Mail compose body does
  not expose selected text through AX until content exists, so live preview is
  inert there rather than failing (documented limitation).
- Pages: blocked by a macOS automation-permission prompt during the campaign;
  code path is shared with TextEdit.

## Efficiency

- Unchanged selection: no provider call (asserted by
  `test_preview_cache_prevents_duplicate_provider_calls`).
- Debounce: one call per selection change (asserted by
  `test_service_decision_flow_skips_unchanged`).
- Output capped at 512 tokens / 12 edits; context capped at 200 chars per side;
  selection capped at 1500 chars; preview defaults to Local AI (zero cloud
  tokens).

## Build

- `./build_macos.sh arm64` completed: app signed with the ByteMind Developer ID,
  notarized and stapled (Apple status `Accepted` for both app and installer).
- Installer: `ByteProof_Installer_AppleSilicon.dmg`.
